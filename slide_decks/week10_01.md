## Unit 10.01: Spatial data and intro to viz

### Dr. Bitterman

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Project update presentation(s)
- Slides, discussion and exercises
- For next class

---

# Open discussion

---

# Today's prep:

- We'll use *unit10inclass.zip* from Canvas
- Open Anaconda
- Wait

---

# Packages/modules we'll need today
- geopandas
- matplotlib

---

# Reading spatial data

### What are some possible forms (and sources) of spatial data?

---
# Package setup

```python
%matplotlib inline
import geopandas
import matplotlib
```

---

# Reading spatial data

### A zip file from the web (you may want to copy-paste the URL)
```python
# reading from the web
# this is a zip file hosted on my Dropbox account. The zip contains a .shp file
muni_url = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhojjephcr3ky54/muni_boundaries.zip?dl=1"
muni_boundaries = geopandas.read_file(muni_url)
```

###

```python
muni_boundaries.plot()
muni_boundaries.crs
```
### What happened?

---

# Reading from geojson

### Wait, what's a geojson?
### What's a "json"?

### *Open street_centerlines_lc.geojson in a text editor and see for yourself*


---

# Reading a geojson

```python
# Read from geojson
streets_path = "./unit10data/street_centerlines_lc.geojson"

streets = geopandas.read_file(streets_path)
```
### display

```python
streets.plot() # may take a while 
streets.crs
```
### Be careful with geojson, files get HUGE

---

# And shapefiles too

```python
# Read a bog standard shapefile
schools_path = "./unit10data/Public_Schools.shp"
schools = geopandas.read_file(schools_path)
schools
```

### display
```python
schools.plot()
```

---

# Anything notable about how we read these 3 file types into memory?

---

# geopandas dataframes are a LOT like non-spatial dataframes

### ESDA is ALWAYS a good idea... what's "ESDA"?

- all the operations we've used before still work:
- try some:
    - head()
    - tail()
    - describe()
    - max() (again, might not make sense for some data)

---

# Slicing a spatial dataframe

- just like aspatial dataframes, we can look at a subset
- let's try a few:

```python
streets.loc[2500, 'geometry'] # you don't always get a good look the geometry, depending on scale
```

```python
muni_boundaries.loc[577, 'geometry']
```
### What happened?

---

# Some basic styling

### Setting an alpha value

```python
schools.plot(alpha = 0.1)
```
### What happened?

---

# Super simple mapping

```python
# Setup figure and axis
f, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(1)

# Plot layer of polygons on the axis
muni_boundaries.plot(ax = ax)

# Remove axis frames
ax.set_axis_off()

# Add figure title
f.suptitle("Municipalities in Nebraska")

# Display
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```
---

# What did we just do?

1. We have first created a figure named f with one axis named ax by using the command ```matplotlib.pyplot.subplots``` *(Note  the method is returning two elements and we can assign each of them to objects with different name (f and ax) by simply listing them at the front of the line, separated by commas)*

2. We plot the geographies, but tell the function that we want it to draw the polygons on the axis we are passing, *ax*. This method returns the axis with the geographies in them, so we make sure to store it on an object with the same name, ax.

3. We remove the box with coordinates

4. We set a title

5. diplayed the figure by calling ```matplotlib.pyplot.show()```


---

# A quick multilayer example

- We can do some simple multilayer mapping by adding layers one at a time to a figure
- For example:

```python
lc_path = "./unit10data/lancaster_county.shp"
lc = geopandas.read_file(lc_path)

# Setup figure and axis
f, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots(1)

# Add a layer with polygon on to axis `ax`
lc.plot(ax = ax, color = "green")

# Add a layer with lines on top in axis `ax`
streets.plot(ax = ax, color = "yellow")

# give it a title
f.suptitle("What a horrible color scheme")
```

---

# We can also do some basic calculations...

### Calculate area

```python
muni_areas = muni_boundaries.area
muni_areas.head()
```
### what happened? Does it make sense?

---

# Always project your data!!!

### What does this code do?
```python
munis_14n = muni_boundaries.to_crs(epsg=26914) # EPSG for NAD84 UTM 14N
muni_areas = munis_14n.area
muni_areas.head()
```
### What are the units now?

---

# Lengths, too:

```python
street_length = streets.to_crs(epsg=26914).length
street_length.head()
```

### Garbage in, garbage out (know your datasets)... this works:

```python
streets.to_crs(epsg=26914).area.head()
```
### What's wrong with it?

---

# And buffers are straightforward:

### Break it down:
```python
schools14n = schools.to_crs(munis_14n.crs) # set to the CRS of an existing layer
schools14n.crs

school_buff = schools14n.buffer(500) # 500m buffer 
school_buff.head()
```

```python
school_buff.plot() # at this scale, maybe a bit tough to tell they're buffers
```
