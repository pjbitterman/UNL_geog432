# ModelBuilder exercise

## The problem:

 Suppose you are working on a site selection problem where you need to select all areas that fall within 10 miles of a major highway and 10 miles of a major city. The selected area cannot lie in the ocean or outside the United States. 
 
 Solving the problem requires that you make buffers around both the roads and the cities, intersect the buffers, then clip to the US outline. Instead of manually opening the Buffer tool twice, followed by the Intersect tool, then the Clip tool, you can set this up in ModelBuilder to run as one process.
