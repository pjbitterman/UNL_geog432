# Your tasks:

### Using ```AdopotanAsh_BH_220308.zip``` from the GitHub repository:

1. Make a map showing the density of street trees across Lincoln
2. Make a *different kind of* map showing the densit of *ash trees* across Lincoln
3. Get boundary data from https://opendata.lincoln.ne.gov/search?tags=boundaries (I don't care which boundaries - it's up to you)
4. Calculate the total number of trees (or the number of ash trees) in each spatial unit from the boundaries data
5. If you have time, make a choropleth map of the counts/unit, then overlay the individual points on top. Use legible symbology and good cartographic practices
