# Functions

A function in Python performs a specific task. Nearly all geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro are provided as functions in ArcPy. In addition, ArcPy provides several functions that are not tools. Functions can list datasets, retrieve properties of a dataset, check for the existence of data, validate names of datasets, and perform many other useful tasks. These functions are designed for Python workflows, and therefore are available only in ArcPy and not as tools in ArcGIS Pro. These functions are sometimes referred to as nontool functions. To summarize, nearly all geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro are functions in ArcPy, but not all ArcPy functions are geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro.
The general form of a function is like that of a tool. A function has parameters (also referred to as arguments), which can be required or optional. A function returns values. These values can be a path to a dataset, a string, a number, a Boolean value, or a geoprocessing object.
The syntax of a function in ArcPy is the same as for tools:
arcpy.<functionname>(<arguments>)
For example, the following code determines whether a dataset exists, and then prints either True or False:
import arcpy
print(arcpy.Exists("C:/Data.streams.shp"))
The arcpy.Exists() function returns a Boolean value. Other functions return other types of values, including strings and numbers.
There are many ArcPy functions, which can be divided into the following categories:
ArcGIS Online/Portal
Cursors
Data store
Describing data
Environments and settings
Fields
General
General data functions
Geodatabase administration
Geometry
Getting and setting parameters
Licensing and installation
Listing data
Log history
Messaging and error handling
Progress dialog box
Publishing
Raster
Spatial references and transformations
Tools and toolboxes
These categories are created primarily to provide a logical organization of the functions, but the names of these categories do not appear in Python syntax. Unlike tools, these functions are always called directly, without reference to the category. ArcGIS Pro helps provide a complete list of ArcPy functions and a detailed description of each. Later chapters revisit several of these functions.
Technically speaking, nearly all geoprocessing tools are functions in ArcPy, and they are accessed like any other Python function. To avoid confusion, ArcPy functions are divided into tool functions and nontool functions. There are several important distinctions between the two:
The documentation is in different sections of ArcGIS Pro help. Tools are documented under Tool Reference. The documentation also can be obtained from the tool dialog box when running a tool in ArcGIS Pro. Nontool functions are documented only in the ArcPy documentation under the Python tab of the ArcGIS Pro help pages.
Tools are licensed by license level (Basic, Standard, and Advanced) and by extension (3D Analyst, Network Analyst, Spatial Analyst, and more). The Tool Reference indicates the license level that is required for each tool. Nontool functions, on the other hand, are not licensed separately. All ArcPy nontool functions are available to use with ArcPy, independent of the license level.
Tools produce geoprocessing messages, which can be accessed through a variety of functions. Nontool functions do not produce these messages.
Calling tools requires the use of the toolbox alias or the module name, whereas nontool functions do not.
Later chapters explore many of these nontool functions.
