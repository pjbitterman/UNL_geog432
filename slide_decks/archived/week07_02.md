# Open discussion

### How's lab 3 going?

---

# Geometries

---

# It's useful to remember our spatial topologies

- Points: 0-dimensional
- Lines: 1-dimensional, made of two points and an arc
- Polygons: 2-dimensional, made up of lines

---

# The structure of geometries

- So far, we've looked at feature classes mostly with respect to their attributes
- But there's a geometry attribute as well... accessed with the ```SHAPE@``` syntax

### Let's try - open ArcGIS Pro and the week/unit 7 data

```python
workspace_string = "C:\\Users\\pjbitterman\\Dropbox\\GEOG432\\week07\\week07data"
arcpy.env.workspace = workspace_string
streams = "Streams_303_d_.shp"

with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(streams, "SHAPE@") as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        print(row[0])
```
### What happened?

---

# ```SHAPE@``` gives you access to many geometry-related properties

### Let's try:

```python
streams = "Streams_303_d_.shp"

with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(streams, "SHAPE@Length") as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        print(row[0])
```
See for more properties: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/reading-geometries.htm



---

# And we can do more

```python
streams = "Streams_303_d_.shp"

with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(streams, "SHAPE@Length") as cursor:
    length_total = 0
    
    for row in cursor:
        length_total += row[0]
    print(length_total)
```

## Straightforward?

---

# Let's create some geometry

### General syntax
```python
arcpy.Geometry(geometry, inputs, {spatial_reference}, {has_z}, {has_m})
```
### Specifying a point is **not** the same as creating a Geometry object

```python
point = arcpy.Point(100, 500)
arcpy.PointGeometry(point, 26914)
```
### ```26914``` is the "factory code" for the CRS. Can use other representations too

---

# Let's make a line

### Break it down
```python
point_a = arcpy.Point(0,0)
point_b = arcpy.Point(100, 500)
listOfPoints = arcpy.Array([point_a, point_b])
myline = arcpy.Polyline(listOfPoints, 26914)

print(myline.length)
myline
```
### What happened?

---

# and we can do simple checks:

### What does this code do?
```python
point_1a = arcpy.Point(0,0)
point_1b = arcpy.Point(100, 500)
listOfPoints_1 = arcpy.Array([point_1a, point_1b])
myline_1 = arcpy.Polyline(listOfPoints_1, 26914)

point_2a = arcpy.Point(100,0)
point_2b = arcpy.Point(0, 500)
listOfPoints_2 = arcpy.Array([point_2a, point_2b])
myline_2 = arcpy.Polyline(listOfPoints_2, 26914)

print(myline_1.crosses(myline_2))
#myline_1
#myline_2
```
---

# and some automation:

```python
mylistofxy = [[0, 1], [4, 6], [2, 2.33], [1, 1]]

listOfPoints = arcpy.Array()

for (x, y) in mylistofxy:
    mypoint = arcpy.Point(x,y)
    listOfPoints.append(mypoint)

myline = arcpy.Polyline(listOfPoints, 26914)
print(myline.length)

myline
```

---
# something (just) a bit different

### Let's make a multipoint geometry
```python
mylistofxy = [[0, 1], [4, 6], [2, 2.33], [1, 1]]

listOfPoints = arcpy.Array()

for (x, y) in mylistofxy:
    mypoint = arcpy.Point(x,y)
    listOfPoints.append(mypoint)

arcpy.Multipoint(listOfPoints)
```
### What happened?


---
# you can do interesting work with a Geometry object:

### How is this different?
```python
mylistofxy = [[0, 1], [4, 6], [2, 2.33], [1, 1]]

listOfPoints = arcpy.Array()

for (x, y) in mylistofxy:
    mypoint = arcpy.Point(x,y)
    listOfPoints.append(mypoint)

myMp = arcpy.Multipoint(listOfPoints)
myMp.convexHull()
```
### Your result?

---
# Back to the task(s) from last class:

*For all state parks within 2 miles of a municipal boundry, figure out the size (in acres) of the parks and what county they are in. Print the output like:*

```
Arbor Lodge SHP is 56.788745 acres and in Otoe County
```

### Optional bonus points (only try once you've completed above):
- (easier) Format the park size such that it only prints 2 decimal places
- (harder) Include what muncipality they are nearest to
- (even harder) Print whether the state parks are within 10 miles of a 303d stream
