#

## Unit 08.02: Raster math and reclassifcation

### Dr. Bitterman

#

--- 

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Slides, discussion and exercises
     - Wednesday: raster algebra and more
- For next class

---

# Open discussion

---

# Raster data structure review

1. What's a raster dataset?
2. How are they used?
3. What are the key properties of a raster?
4. Any other concerns (e.g., toppolgy) that you're aware of?

---

# Today's prep:

- We're using the same data as Monday (*unit08inclass.zip*)
- Open a new project (or the one from Monday)
- Start a new Jupyter notebook in ArcGIS Pro
- Setup your workspace

---

# Reclassification

* What does it mean to "reclassify" a raster?
* When might you reclassify a raster?
* What does your textbook say about how we do it?
    * Values
    * Ranges
* Using our for loop from Friday, how might we implement a reclassify?

---

# Using built-in methods

### Syntax:
```python
Reclassify(in_raster, reclass_field, remap, {missing_values})
```
- in_raster: the raster you're working on
- reclass_filed: the field you are reclassifying
- remap: an object that describes the reclassifcation
- {missing_values}: how to handle missing values

---

# From last class:

### How did this work again?
```python
myraster.save("nlcd_test")
testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

for x, y in testraster:
    if testraster[x,y] == 41 or testraster[x,y] == 81:
        testraster[x,y] = 71
        
testraster.save()
```

---
# Reclassifying with values

### How does this one work? Let's break it down
```python
myraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_lc_14n")
myraster.save("nlcd_test")

testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

myfield = "VALUE"
myremap = arcpy.sa.RemapValue([[41, 71],[81, 71]])

outraster_value = arcpy.sa.Reclassify(testraster, myfield, myremap)
```
### What happened?

---
# Reclassifying with ranges

### break it down
```python
myraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_lc_14n")
myraster.save("nlcd_test")

testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

myfield = "VALUE"
myremap = arcpy.sa.RemapRange([[41, 51, 71], [80, 89, 71]])

outraster_range = arcpy.sa.Reclassify(testraster, myfield, myremap)
```

---

# How would you test/display what cells changed?

---

# A simple change detection

### What's this code doing?
```python
change_detect_val = myraster == outraster_value
```

---

# Raster algebra

## Arithmetic functions:
### +, -, /, *

## Relational functions:
### ==, <, >, !=

## Also: Boolean and bitwise (see your book)


---

# Assumptions of raster algebra:

* Same resolution
* Same extent
* Orthogonal

*(But Arc will "cheat it" for you)*

---

# You have some rasters... give it a shot. Try out a few operators

---

# Your final task:

- Imagine a habitat suitability analysis for the will spotted hookbilled two-legged platypus (it's real, trust me ;))
- Criteria: only lives in wetlands below 400m
- Your task: find the suitable habitat using the tools we used today

### *(do we want to start on the whiteboard?)*

# For next class

- Lab 4 starts Friday
- Next week's readings are linked on Canvas
