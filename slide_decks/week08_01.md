## Unit 08.01: Rasters

### Dr. Bitterman

#

--- 

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Reading raster data sets, interrogating the data structure, raster algebra and more
- For next class

---

# Open discussion

### How's lab 3 going?
### Projects?

---

# Raster data structure review

1. What is a raster dataset?
2. How are they used?
3. What are the key properties of a raster?
4. Any other concerns (e.g., toppolgy) that you're aware of?

---

# Raster processing in ArcPy

- Requires the Spatial Analyst module (```arcpy.sa.*```)
- Which requires the proper license (check your textbook for how to do it programmatically)
- Your book likes to do the following:

```python
import arcpy
from arcpy.sa import *

#then you can call functions directly, for example
outraster = Slope(elev)
```

### I am not a fan of importing *, I prefer to be more explicit (but you do you)

```python
#my way
outraster = arcpy.sa.Slope(elev)
```

---

# Download the *week08inclass.zip* file from Canvas

* Start a new project
* Extract the data
* Create a new arcpy notebook

---

# Let's start with listing our data

- How have we done this in the past?
- Listing rasters is pretty similar

```python
wkspc_string = "C:\\Users\\pjbitterman\\Dropbox\\GEOG432\\week8_rasters\\unit08_data"
arcpy.env.workspace = wkspc_string

arcpy.ListRasters()
```
## Give it a shot - what were the results?

---

# Let's read one

### How is reading rasters different than reading feature classes?
```python
# read
myraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_lc_14n")
# display
myraster
```
### What happened?

---

# How do we learn something about our datasets?

---

# We can "describe" our rasters, just like feature classes

### For example... 
### before you try it, what's the output?
```python
mydesc = arcpy.da.Describe(myraster)
mydesc
```
---

# Checking raster properties
```python
print(mydesc["dataType"])
print(mydesc["bandCount"])
print(mydesc["compressionType"])
print(mydesc["height"])
print(mydesc["width"])
print(mydesc["meanCellHeight"])
print(mydesc["meanCellWidth"])
print(mydesc["pixelType"])
print(mydesc["isInteger"])
print(mydesc["noDataValue"])
```
## Try a few

---

# We can also access cells directly to determine their values:

### Let's break it down: what does the code do?
```python
for x, y in myraster:
    if(x < 10 and y < 10):
        print(x, y, myraster[x, y])

```
### What happened?

---

# Modifying values directly

### As always, let's break it down
```python
myraster.save("nlcd_test")
testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

for x, y in testraster:
    if testraster[x,y] == 41 or testraster[x,y] == 81:
        testraster[x,y] = 71
        
testraster.save()
```
### What happened? How can you check it worked?


---

# Using "canned" geoprocessing functions

- Let's use ```ned30lc.tif``` to develop a raster that describes the slope of the landscape

- But first: 
    - what is ```ned30lc.tif```? 
    - How would you know?

---

# Calculating slope from a DEM

```python
in_dem = arcpy.Raster("ned30lc.tif")

outraster = arcpy.sa.Slope(in_dem)
outraster.save("myslope.tif")
```
### What happened?

---

# Reclassification

* What does it mean to "reclassify" a raster?
* When might you reclassify a raster?
* What does your textbook say about how we do it?
    * Values
    * Ranges
* Using our for loop from last class, how might we implement a reclassify?

---

# Using built-in methods

### Syntax:
```python
Reclassify(in_raster, reclass_field, remap, {missing_values})
```
- in_raster: the raster you're working on
- reclass_field: the field you are reclassifying
- remap: an object that describes the reclassifcation
- {missing_values}: how to handle missing values

---

# Reclassifying with values

### How does this one work? Let's break it down
```python
myraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_lc_14n")
myraster.save("nlcd_test")

testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

myfield = "VALUE"
myremap = arcpy.sa.RemapValue([[41, 71],[81, 71]])

outraster_value = arcpy.sa.Reclassify(testraster, myfield, myremap)
```
### What happened?

---

# Reclassifying with ranges

### break it down
```python
myraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_lc_14n")
myraster.save("nlcd_test")

testraster = arcpy.Raster("nlcd_test")
testraster.readOnly = False

myfield = "VALUE"
myremap = arcpy.sa.RemapRange([[41, 51, 71], [80, 89, 71]])

outraster_range = arcpy.sa.Reclassify(testraster, myfield, myremap)
```

---

# How could you test/display what cells changed?

---

# A simple change detection

### What's this code doing?
```python
change_detect_val = myraster == outraster_value
```

---

# Raster algebra

## Arithmetic functions:
### +, -, /, *

## Relational functions:
### ==, <, >, !=

## Also: Boolean and bitwise (see your book)

---

# Assumptions of raster algebra:

* Same resolution
* Same extent
* Orthogonal

*(But ArcGIS will "cheat it" for you)*

---

# You have some rasters... give it a shot. Try out a few operators

---

# Your final task:

- Imagine a habitat suitability analysis for the will spotted hookbilled two-legged platypus (it's real, trust me ðŸ˜‰ )
- Criteria: only lives in wetlands below 400m
- Your task: find the suitable habitat using the tools we used today

### *(do we want to start on the whiteboard?)*

# For next class

- Read Chapter 10 for this week
