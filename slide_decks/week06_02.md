# Open discussion

### How's lab 2 going?

---

# Using SQL

- SQL: "Structured query language"

Three main components:
1. SELECT: What attributes (columns) you are selecting
2. FROM: The table you're selecting from
3. WHERE: The condition you impose on the records (rows)

### A simple example

```
SELECT * FROM 'my_table' WHERE "Tot_pop < 54254"
```

---

# Let's try it

## Open your project from last class

### Make sure your workspace and objects (feature classes) are loaded into memory

---

# Here's a SQL example

### Let's break it down

```python
with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(fc, ["NAME10", "Total"], ' "Total" > 256465 ') as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        print(row[0], row[1])
```

### What happened?

---

# See your textbook (Chapter 8) for more SQL examples and fancier syntax

---

# Update cursors

---

# Let's pose a problem:

## *Given our dataset, how would we calculate the population density (people/unit area)?*

## To the whiteboard!

---

# One way of accomplishing our tasks


### Break it down - what does the code do and why?
```python
arcpy.management.AddField(fc, "pop_den", "Double")

with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, ["ALAND10", "TOTAL", "pop_den"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        row[2] = row[0] / row[1]
        cursor.updateRow(row) # You need to tell the cursor to update the row
```
### What happened?


---

# We can delete records too

### First, let's make a copy we can "play" with
```python
arcpy.management.CopyFeatures(fc, "mycopy_to_delete_later.shp")
```

### Then, let's selectively delete rows <- what does the below code do?

```python
with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor("mycopy_to_delete_later.shp", ["NAME10"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        if(row[0] == "Lancaster"):
            cursor.deleteRow()
cursor.reset()
```

### Did it work? Check it in your map
*(if the view didn't update, click the "refresh" button in the bottom-right)*


---

# Let's do one more

### Breakdown the code:
```python
with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor("mycopy_to_delete_later.shp", ["NAME10", "Total"]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        if(row[1] < 20000):
            cursor.deleteRow()
cursor.reset()
```

---

# On your own:

1. Make another copy of our original dataset
2. only *retain* records where there are *more Females in their 50s than Females in their 20s*
3. Print the county names

# For next class

- Lab 2 is due Thursday
- Read Chapter 8 this week
