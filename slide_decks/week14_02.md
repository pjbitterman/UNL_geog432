# Your tasks:

### Using ```county_boundaries.zip``` from GitHub data directory...

1. Identify "similar" counties using a clustering method and using metrics you define in your group
2. Map the counties using a categorical classification scheme and good cartographic practices
3. Test SOME OF (3-4 variables) your input data for spatial autocorrelation
4. Can you test your cluster assignments for spatial autocorrelation? Why or why not?
