# Reflection activity (3-5 min)

1. **WRITE DOWN** 2-3 things you can *now* do that you couldn't when the semester started
2. On the first day, you were asked what "success would look like" at the end of the semester. Were you successful?

## Pair-and-share (find a buddy)

### Share: 
- your new skills
- your favorite thing about the course (e.g., new skills, activities, Dr. Bitterman's dry wit and towering intellect, etc...)
- your measure of success *and* how well you did
