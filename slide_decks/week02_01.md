# Geoprocessing

## What is geoprocessing?

A process

- to perform spatial analysis and modeling
- automate GIS tasks

A typical geoprocessing tool:
1. takes input data (a feature class, raster, or table)
2. performs a geoprocessing task
3. produces output data as a result

# loads o' tools

ArcGIS Pro contains > 1000 geoprocessing tools
Examples:
- buffer
- adding a field to a table
- geocoding a table of addresses.

# Invoking geoprocessing

## Options:
1. Work with the ArcGIS Pro GUI
2. Use the GUI to batch tasks
3. Create your own workflow or tool *(what's the difference)* with **ModelBuilder**
4. Use Python

# Let's start with the GUI

*Why are we starting with the GUI?*

- A refresher (or new intro) to ArcPro tools
- Helps us understand how each tool works
- Visualization is useful when we're starting out
- Can expose underlying frameworks for processing, batching, and automating tasks
