## Unit 05.01: Interrogating spatial data structures

### Dr. Bitterman

#

--- 

# Today's schedule

- Open discussion
- Discussion and exercises
- For next class
- Maybe some work time?

---

# Open discussion

- Lab 2 progress?

---

# Does the data exist?

### *Why do (or should) we check if the data exist?*

The syntax of the Exists() function is: 
```python 
arcpy.Exists(<dataset>)
```

For example:
```python
import arcpy
print(arcpy.Exists("C:/Data/streams.shp"))
```

### *What does it return?*

- Remember, two types of paths
    1. **System paths:** these are the paths recognized by the operating system
    2. **Catalog paths:** these are the paths that only ArcGIS Pro recognizes

---

## But what if we want to know more about our data?

---

# Describing data

- Certain tools only work certain types of data
- For example...
    - **Union:** requires 2 polygon feature classes
- ArcGIS Pro GUI tool dialog boxes have built-in type validation
- In Python, **you** have to determine the feature type of a dataset before using it in a tool

### *But it's YOUR script, why bother with type validation?*

---

# Functions to describe data

Two primary ways:
1. ```arcpy.Describe()```
2. ```arcpy.da.Describe()```

Accomplish same tasks, but structured a bit differently 

- ```da.Describe()``` is newer, and ESRI encourages its use
- but ```arcpy.Describe()``` is functionally fine, and NOT deprecated
---

# ```Describe()```

- ```Describe()``` returns an object of type Describe
- Describe object properties are *dynamic* - differ by the object being described!
    - Flexible
    - Sometimes confusing... 

### which is why checking for types is useful!

---
# ```da.Describe()```

- Returns the same information as ```Describe()```, but the result is a **dictionary**
- Wait, what's a dictionary?

---

# The dictionary data structure

### Main property is ```key:value``` pairs

Example (from W3schools)
```python
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict) # prints dictionary contents
print(thisdict["year"]) # prints 1964
```

---

# Let's try  it

---

# using ```arcpy.Describe()```

- Open an ArcGIS Pro project, create a new notebook
- Using ```Streams_303_d_``` feature class from week03inclass dataset

General Syntax: ```arcpy.Describe(<input dataset>, {datatype})```

Our example (note: you can setup a workspace or point directly to the shapefile)

### First, what do we expect the code to do?

```python
import arcpy
desc = arcpy.Describe("C:/YOURLOCATION/Streams_303_d_.shp")
print(desc.shapeType)
```

### What happened?

---
# Try with ```da.Describe()```

General syntax is ```arcpy.da.Describe(<input dataset>, {datatype})```

### First, what do we expect the code to do?

```python
import arcpy
desc = arcpy.da.Describe("C:/YOURLOCATION/Streams_303_d_.shp")
print(desc["shapeType"])
```
### What happened?

---

# So how is this useful?

Textbook example:
```python
import arcpy
arcpy.env.workspace = "C:/Data"
infc = "streams.shp"
clipfc = "study.shp"
outfc = "streams_clip.shp"
desc = arcpy.da.Describe(clipfc)
type = desc["shapeType"]
if type == "Polygon":
    arcpy.Clip_analysis(infc, clipfc, outfc)
else:
    print("The clip features are not polygons.")
```

### Let's break down the code -- what does it do?

---

# Another example

```python
import arcpy
fc = "C:/Data/streams.shp"
desc = arcpy.da.Describe(fc)
sr = desc["spatialReference"]
print("Dataset type: " + desc["shapeType"])
print("Spatial reference: " + sr.name)
```
### Let's break down the code -- what does it do?

---

# Even more utility

```python
import arcpy
arcpy.env.workspace = "C:/Data/study.gdb"
element = "roads"
desc = arcpy.da.Describe(element)
print("Data type: " + desc["dataType"])
print("File path: " + desc["path"])
print("Catalog path: " + desc["catalogPath"])
print("File name: " + desc["file"])
print("Base name: " + desc["baseName"])
print("Name: " + desc["name"])
```
### Let's break down the code -- what does it do?

---

# Let's use it with our data (back to our earlier example)

```python
import arcpy
desc = arcpy.da.Describe("C:/YOURLOCATION/Streams_303_d_.shp")
print("Shape type:" + desc["shapeType"])
print("Data type: " + desc["dataType"])
print("File path: " + desc["path"])
print("Catalog path: " + desc["catalogPath"])
print("File name: " + desc["file"])
print("Base name: " + desc["baseName"])
print("Name: " + desc["name"])
```
### What happened?

---

# Can you envision utility in your labs? In your project? In research/jobs?

# For next class:

- Read Chapters 6 & 7 for this week
