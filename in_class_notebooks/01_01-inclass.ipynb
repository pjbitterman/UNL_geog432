    "- From algebra: a letter can represent any number, like in ```x + 2```\n",
    "- In computer science, variables represent *values* or *objects* we want the computer to store in its memory for later use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables don't only represent numbers\n",
    "  - ...but also text and Boolean values (‘true’ or ‘false’)\n",
    "  - input from the program’s user\n",
    "  - to store values returned from another program\n",
    "  - to represent constants\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why use variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables make your code readable and flexible\n",
    "- Hard-coded values (also called \"magic numbers\"), mean your code is useful only in one particular scenario\n",
    "- You can manually change the values in your code to fit a different scenario\n",
    "  - tedious\n",
    "  - greater risk of making a mistake\n",
    "- Variables allow your code to be useful in many scenarios and are easy to *parameterize*, meaning you can let users change the values\n",
